<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_specification" target="_blank" title="interactive design specification">Interactive design</a> is a <strong>user-oriented <u>field</U> of <u>study</u></strong> that focuses on meaningful communication of media through cyclical and collaborative processes between people and technology. Successful interactive designs have simple, clearly defined goals, a strong purpose and intuitive screen interface In some cases interactive design is equated to interaction design however, in the specialized study of interactive design there are defined differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">To assist in this distinction, interaction design can be thought of as:

    Making devices usable, useful, and fun, focusing on the efficiency and intuitive hardware
    A fusion of product design, computer science, and communication design
    A process of solving specific problems under a specific set of contextual circumstances
    The creation of form for the behavior of products, services, environments, and systems
    Making dialogue between technology and user invisible, i.e. reducing the limitations of communication through and with technology.
    About connecting people through various products and services.</P>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Where as interactive design can be thought of as:
Giving purpose to interaction design through meaningful experiences
Consisting of six main components including User control, Responsiveness, Real-Time Interactions, Connectedness, Personalization, and Playfulness
Focuses on the use and experience of the software
Retrieving and processing information through on-demand responsiveness
Acting upon information to transform it
The constant changing of information and media, regardless of changes in the device
Providing interactivity through a focus on the capabilities and constraints of human cognitive processing</p>
